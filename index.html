      <article role="main" class="blog-post">
        <p>This is a full write up of how to complete the demo CTF I presented at my 
Intro to Ethical Hacking talk for UQCS.</p>

<p>The VM for the demo can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mc09CuJHtrj1Q5v9TpFyNTyNRQaUUYLq/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. The demo 
was built from another CTF available on vulnhub <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/basic-pentesting-1,216/">here</a>, but I decided to make various changes to
make it slightly more challenging.</p>

<p>Throughout the write-up all commands which I have run on my attacking machine 
will be in code-blocks.</p>

<p>I recommend downloading and installing Kali Linux as another virtual machine
and use it as your attacking machine. Kali Linux is a distribution designed
for penetration testing, and contains all of the tools you could want to get 
started doing some ethical hacking. It is definitely not required, but is  
convenient, especially when you're getting started.</p>

<hr />
<h1 id="walkthrough">Walkthrough</h1>
<p>First we need to discover the IP address of the target. The default host-only 
subnet created by virtualbox <code class="highlighter-rouge">vboxnet0</code> will be the subnet 192.168.56.1/24, in order to
find the specific IP address of the target we will conduct a ping sweep of the
subnet.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ nmap -sn 192.168.56.1/24
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/intro-to-ethical-hacking-talk/img/ehtalk/ping-scan.png" alt="pingscan" /></p>

<p>nmap reports only finding two hosts, 192.168.56.1 is the attacking machine, we can verify this by:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ip addr show vboxnet0
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img src="/intro-to-ethical-hacking-talk/img/ehtalk/ipaddr.png" alt="ipaddr" /></p>

<p>We can safely assume that the only other host 192.168.56.101 discovered by the ping sweep is our target (The address may be different on your machine depending on
your virtualbox settings)</p>

<hr />

<p>Next we perform a port scan and run the default category of scripts and service version number enumeration by:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ nmap -sC -sV -oN init.nmap 192.168.56.101
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/intro-to-ethical-hacking-talk/img/ehtalk/nmap-script.png" alt="portscan" /></p>

<p>You should also scan the full TCP port range to see if if anything was missed,
 and don’t forget there's also UDP ports which could be open.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ nmap -sC -sC -p- -oN full-TCP.nmap 192.168.56.101
$ nmap -sU -p- -oN full-UDP.nmap 192.168.56.101
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>nmap has discovered 3 open ports and the scripting engine has managed to
enumerate the version numbers of the services listening on the discovered ports,
along with some additional information. (I decided to cut the ftp service from 
the live demo in order to save a bit of time)</p>

<hr />

<p>We can search the <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/">exploit-db</a> database for any
publicly disclosed exploits for the services we have identified. The easiest
way to do this is with the tool <code class="highlighter-rouge">searchsploit</code>. Its good to search for just the
major version number initially, as many exploits will be listed as ranges such
as <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt; 3.7</code> and searching for <code class="highlighter-rouge">3.6</code> will not return a match. If the query returns
many results then you can search more specifically, or use <code class="highlighter-rouge">grep</code> to do some 
filtering.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ searchsploit vsftpd 3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/intro-to-ethical-hacking-talk/img/ehtalk/searchsploit.png" alt="searchsploit" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately there doesn’t seem to be any matches for this ftp service in this
database. You can also checkout some other websites such as <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/">cve.mitre.org</a> and <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">nvd.nist.gov</a> to see if there are 
any publicly disclosed vulnerabilities for the service.</p>

<p>Additionally we should search for vulnerabilities in the other services:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ searchsploit openssh 7.2
$ searchsploit apache 2.4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Looks like there is a username enumeration exploit which we could use to do
some brute forcing against the <code class="highlighter-rouge">openssh</code> service. There is also a memory leak
exploit which we could use against the <code class="highlighter-rouge">apache</code> service, both worth adding to
our list of things to try.</p>

<hr />

<p>The nmap has reported that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ftp</code> service is accepting anonymous logins. 
This is great because we can login and poke around any files the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ftp</code> service
is serving. Anonymous login sounds like its asking for trouble but it actually
has a legitimate use case for when you want to distribute files via ftp but
don’t want to create and manage credentials for every user wishing to download
your content. You’ll see it being used by many different software vendors to 
distribute different versions of their software etc.</p>

<p>Let’s login and see if we can find anything:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ftp 192.168.56.101
Name (192.168.56.101:nomad): anonymous
Password: anyPasswordILike
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/intro-to-ethical-hacking-talk/img/ehtalk/ftp.png" alt="ftp" /></p>

<p>It seems this <code class="highlighter-rouge">ftp</code> service is only serving an empty directory. You should also
test if the service will allow you to upload files anonymously:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ echo test &gt; test.txt
ftp&gt; put test.txt
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>However we get Permission Denied. If we were allowed to upload anonymously, it
would give us the opportunity to place some of our own code on the target and 
attempt to get it to execute.</p>

<p>Seems like the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ftp</code> service is a dead end, moving on to <code class="highlighter-rouge">ssh</code>.</p>

<hr />

<p>We have identified there is an exploit which will allow us to figure out valid
usernames via brute force. Even if this username enumeration exploit works, we
would still need to also brute force the password for any user accounts discovered.
I would generally leave brute forcing tasks as a last
resort if we are unable to find another way in, as it is very slow and a good
way to get your IP address blocked if the target is monitoring for brute force
attempts. Lets leave the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ssh</code> service alone for now and move on to the web 
server.</p>

<hr />

<p>The first step in attacking any web application is to just point a browser at 
it and interact with the site as if we are a normal user, getting a feel for
what the site does and what features it has.</p>

<p><img src="/intro-to-ethical-hacking-talk/img/ehtalk/odin.png" alt="odin" /></p>

<p>As cool as this website is, it doesn’t appear to have any functionality or contain
any links to other pages. Make sure you view the source code of the page and
see if the developers have left us any comments, sometimes developers are lazy
and just comment out sections of code that don’t work yet, but still publish it
to the live website. This can reveal links to broken pages etc. which may contain
vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>nmap has reported that there is a <code class="highlighter-rouge">robots.txt</code> page for the website, which is 
always a good place to check. <code class="highlighter-rouge">robots.txt</code> provides a way for site developers 
to instruct various web crawlers such as google how to index their site. You can
specify pages that you don’t want to appear in google search results
by placing a disallow entry into <code class="highlighter-rouge">robots.txt</code>. Obviously if the developers don’t
want us there, then as pentesters we absolutely want to check it out.</p>

<p><img src="/intro-to-ethical-hacking-talk/img/ehtalk/robots.png" alt="robots" /></p>

<p>It appears this <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev</code> page is another dead end.</p>

<p>So at this stage we have thoroughly examined all the pages we know about and 
found nothing interesting, but that doesn’t mean there is no more pages to find!</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">apache</code> web server is not going to give us a list of all the pages  
it knows about, so we will have to do some brute forcing and hope we can discover something.</p>

<p>This process is called directory enumeration. My favourite tool for this is 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">gobuster</code> as it has a simple command line interface.</p>

<p>We have to provide a word list for gobuster to use as part of the enumeration.
The list I used comes from <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists">SecLists</a>.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ gobuster -w wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -u http://192.168.56.101 -x php,html,txt 
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img src="/intro-to-ethical-hacking-talk/img/ehtalk/gobuster.png" alt="gobuster" /></p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">gobuster</code> has found a new directory <code class="highlighter-rouge">/secret/</code> for us to look at, lets go there.</p>

<p><img src="/intro-to-ethical-hacking-talk/img/ehtalk/secret.png" alt="secret" /></p>

<p>The page seems to load a wordpress site, but there doesn’t seem to be any css,
and all of the links appear to be broken. You’ll notice however that the links
are actually trying to direct us to a different domain name <code class="highlighter-rouge">vtcsec</code>.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">apache</code> webserver is able to serve multiple websites from a single server,
and one of the mechanisms it can use to decide which website to serve to an 
incoming request is called <code class="highlighter-rouge">VirtualHosts</code>, where it looks at the hostname 
specified in the incoming request.</p>

<p>I had several questions about this after the talk, <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/vhosts/examples.html">here</a> is the documentation from apache which describes whats going on in detail.</p>

<p>Since there is no <code class="highlighter-rouge">DNS</code> server sitting in between our attacking machine and the
target, we can manually add a mapping of <code class="highlighter-rouge">vtcsec</code> -&gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">192.168.56.101</code> by 
creating an entry in our <code class="highlighter-rouge">/etc/hosts</code> file.</p>

<p><img src="/intro-to-ethical-hacking-talk/img/ehtalk/hosts.png" alt="hosts" /></p>

<p>Reloading the page we now see it looks like a proper wordpress site.</p>

<p><img src="/intro-to-ethical-hacking-talk/img/ehtalk/wp1.png" alt="wp1" /></p>

<p>You should browse through the site, clicking through all the links and attempt
to identify any functionality the site has. There is a really nice tool you can
use to automate a lot of the enumeration process for wordpress sites called
<a href="https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan">wpscan</a></p>

<p>Eventually you will find the <code class="highlighter-rouge">wp-login.php</code> page. Login pages will often present
an opportunity to attempt some SQL injection, but additionally you should always
try some default credentials sets, as you’ll be surprised how often people leave
developers leave sites protected with poor passwords (Also very common to see in  CTFs)</p>

<p><img src="/intro-to-ethical-hacking-talk/img/ehtalk/adminadmin.png" alt="adminadmin" /></p>

<p>Here I was able to login with the credentials admin:admin, and now we have
access to the wordpress admin panel!</p>

<p>You should spend some time gathering any additional information you can about 
the target now that we have increased our level of access. Try and enumerate 
usernames, confirm version numbers (of wordpress, and various plugins) etc.</p>

<p>Since we have administrator access to the wordpress site, we have the ability to
modify the sites theme files from the built in code editor. We can use this 
to insert some of our own php code into the site, and hopefully get it to execute.</p>

<p>Browsing to Appearance -&gt; Editor -&gt; footer.php, we can place in some arbitrary 
php code and confirm that we have code execution. When doing this type of attack
it is good practice to always verify that you actually have code execution before
attempting to drop any sort of complicated payload into the mix.
If you’re not able to modify the code to include a random print statement, then
then it is unlikely your more advanced payloads will work.</p>

<p>We can verify we have code execution by placing the line:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>echo shell_exec(id);
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>inside the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;?php ?&gt;</code> tags in the footer.php page and seeing if the output from
the bash <code class="highlighter-rouge">id</code> command prints out to the site.</p>

<p><img src="/intro-to-ethical-hacking-talk/img/ehtalk/php.png" alt="php" /></p>
<p><img src="/intro-to-ethical-hacking-talk/img/ehtalk/verify.png" alt="verify" /></p>

<p>We have confirmed that we have code execution, so let’s try something more
complicated.</p>

<p>We can upload a reverse shell payload and see if we can get it to return a shell
to our attacking machine. I recommend using the php reverse shell from <a href="https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php">pentestmonkey</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/covert/inside-out-vulnerabilities-reverse-shells-1663">Here</a> is some further reading on how reverse shells work.</p>

<hr />

<p>We setup a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ncat</code> listener on our attacking machine using:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo ncat -lvp 443
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We can then trigger the reverse shell by reloading the web page:</p>

<p><img src="/intro-to-ethical-hacking-talk/img/ehtalk/shell.png" alt="shell" /></p>

<p>It worked! We now have user level access to the target. The shell we have
received can be upgraded to be a fully interactive bash shell by following the 
process described in this <a href="https://blog.ropnop.com/upgrading-simple-shells-to-fully-interactive-ttys/">article</a></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ python -c "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash')" 
^Z (Ctrl-z)
$ stty raw -echo 
$ fg
$ reset
Terminal Type? xterm
</code></pre></div></div>

<hr />

<p>We can now start the privilege escalation process. I recommend stepping through
all the steps listed in the awesome blog article <a href="https://blog.g0tmi1k.com/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation/">here</a>. Leave no stone unturned when it comes 
to your enumeration, as the smallest detail could be the difference to you 
detecting a vulnerability or not.</p>

<hr />
<p>Eventually you will stumble on the interesting file <code class="highlighter-rouge">/home/jackson/read_ftp_log</code></p>

<p><img src="/intro-to-ethical-hacking-talk/img/ehtalk/readftp.png" alt="readftp" /></p>

<p>The interesting thing here is the fact that this is an executable file which we
have permission to run, and it also has the <code class="highlighter-rouge">setuid</code> bit set with the owner <code class="highlighter-rouge">root</code>.</p>

<p>This means when we run <code class="highlighter-rouge">read_ftp_log</code>,
our permission level will be effectively changed to the owner (root in this case), in order to run the program.
Checkout <code class="highlighter-rouge">man setuid</code> for a detailed 
explanation of whats going on.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">setuid</code> bit is not a security vulnerability itself, however if used incorrectly it can become one.</p>

<p>Running this interesting program <code class="highlighter-rouge">read_ftp_log</code>, we can see from the output it
is calling the command <code class="highlighter-rouge">cat /var/log/vsftpd.log</code>. Obviously the intention here
is to allow users to read the <code class="highlighter-rouge">vsftpd.log</code> file which is normally restricted.</p>

<p><img src="/intro-to-ethical-hacking-talk/img/ehtalk/runftp.png" alt="runftp" /></p>

<p>We can exploit the fact that this <code class="highlighter-rouge">setuid</code> enabled program is executing 
another program, in this case <code class="highlighter-rouge">cat</code>. When you try to run any program in <code class="highlighter-rouge">bash</code>,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">bash</code> will search through all the directories listed in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">$PATH</code> environment
variable trying to locate the program, and it will run the first match it receives.</p>

<p>You can see what your PATH looks like by:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ echo $PATH
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/intro-to-ethical-hacking-talk/img/ehtalk/path.png" alt="path" /></p>

<p>If we create a new program called <code class="highlighter-rouge">cat</code> and place it on our <code class="highlighter-rouge">$PATH</code> before the
normal version of <code class="highlighter-rouge">cat</code> then when this <code class="highlighter-rouge">read_ftp_log</code> program run and calls <code class="highlighter-rouge">cat</code>
it will run our <code class="highlighter-rouge">cat</code> program instead, and since it has the <code class="highlighter-rouge">setuid</code> bit enabled and is owned by root, it with run our <code class="highlighter-rouge">cat</code> program with root permissions!</p>

<p>So we can create a very simple shell script which will pass us a root shell 
when run by <code class="highlighter-rouge">read_ftp_log</code>.</p>

<p>Our new version of cat will look like this:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>
/bin/bash
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We need a place to actually write this, the best place is in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/tmp</code> 
directory as it will allow any user to write to it.</p>

<p>Create a new directory and place our new <code class="highlighter-rouge">cat</code> program there and give it execute
permission:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ cd /tmp
$ mkdir bin
$ nano cat
...
$ chmod 777 cat
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If <code class="highlighter-rouge">nano</code> complains at you make sure you have the <code class="highlighter-rouge">TERM</code> environment variable set:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ export TERM=xterm
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we can place this <code class="highlighter-rouge">/tmp/bin</code> directory at the start of our <code class="highlighter-rouge">$PATH</code> to ensure
it is the first version of <code class="highlighter-rouge">cat</code> bash will discover:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ export PATH=/tmp/bin:$PATH
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/intro-to-ethical-hacking-talk/img/ehtalk/newpath.png" alt="newpath" /></p>

<p>All that's left now is to run the <code class="highlighter-rouge">read_ftp_log</code> program…</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ cd /home/jackson
$ ./read_ftp_log
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/intro-to-ethical-hacking-talk/img/ehtalk/proof.png" alt="proof" /></p>

<p>We now have a root shell! The CTF is completed and we can find our prize in 
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/root</code> directory:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ cd /root
$ less flag.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/intro-to-ethical-hacking-talk/img/ehtalk/flag.png" alt="flag" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.vulnhub.com">vulnhub</a> - A cool site which hosts many CTF style 
virtual machines which you can use to practice your ethical hacking skills.
Contains many VMs from beginner to advanced level.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu">hackthebox</a> - My personal favourite site to practice
with. Contains vulnerable targets for you to attack however instead of downloading
a VM image, you connect to a vpn and perform your attacks remotely.</p>
